### Attention Deficit Hiperactivity Disrorder (ADHD)

The focus of the proposed research is targeted at immersive soundscapes assisting cognitive and emotional ADHD therapeutic practice. Below are the main ADHD characteristic describing the disorder and will be further referenced as points of intervention for the immersive soundscape implementation.

A. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by: inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The symptoms described as (Wang and Hsu 2018):
1. Concentration of Attention (ADD) - 
The main signs of inattentiveness are:
distracted by sights and sounds in their environment 
cannot concentrate for long periods of time
making careless mistakes – for example, in schoolwork
appearing forgetful or losing things
being unable to stick to tasks that are tedious or time-consuming
appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions
constantly changing activity or task
having difficulty organising tasks
	
2. Impulse/Dragging (HD) – 
	The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are:
being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings
constantly fidgeting
being unable to concentrate on tasks
excessive physical movement
excessive talking
being unable to wait their turn
acting without thinking
interrupting conversations
little or no sense of danger

3. Mixed type (ADHD) – At the same time has the ability to concentrate on the symptoms, easily distracted and unable to restrain themselves

B. Another Symptom originating from the Voeller’s and Heilman’s (1988) study is Spatial Attention/bias. It refers to the perceptual enhancement of stimuli that are presented at certain locations in space (Bellgrove et al. 2008).  They found that boys with the ADHD diagnosis had a tendency to miss visual targets presented to the left side of a sheet of paper in comparison with an age-matched control group. Most, but not all, subsequent reports have been consistent with this conclusion (Manly et al. 2005).

C. ADHD belongs in the emotional disorders as well. 
The emotional impairments of children and adolescents with ADHD may include poor self-regulation of emotion, alexithymia, greater excessive emotional expression, especially anger and aggression, greater problems coping with frustration, reduced empathy, and decreased arousal to stimulation (Wehmeier et at., 2010; Donfrancesco et al. 2013).  

The current EEG neurofeedback treatments focus on cognitive training technics neglecting the emotional factor of the participant.

Karalunas and colleagues (2020) worked on the ways cognitive and emotional processing interact in ADHD as step toward integrating cognitive and emotional theories of the disorder. They highlight the importance of identifying emotion dysregulation in psychopathology, especially in ADHD because individual differences in emotion dysregulation predict impairment. 

On the same trajectory, Shushakova and colleagues (2018) examined the effect (via EEG and EOP) emotionally affective images (IAPS images) had on cognitive effort in patients with ADHD.

Romero-Martínez (2020), one of the very few examples used physiological data (Skin Conductance Levels, SCL), examined the effect of alexithymia relative to the stress and anxiety levels on ADHD male with intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) perpetration. The study reinforces the need to consider psychophysiological measurements when screening the therapeutic needs and the key role of alexithymia when designing cognitive intervention training.

The above recent studies support the need to include emotional analysis in and correlate with the neurofeedback for ADHD treatment. 

While medication is the most effective treatment in ADHD there are a number of concerns. A number of side-effects have been reported according to different types, leading the parents to hesitant. There is insufficient evidence of long-term efficacy of medication (Van de Loo-Neus et al., 2011) as well as the symptoms have been found to reappear after discontinuing drug treatment (Jensen et al., 2007; Murray et al., 2008).

Cognitive-Behavior Therapy constitutes an alternative treatment, even though behavioral modification techniques are complicated and time consuming, and lack of consistency and follow-through can reduce the effectiveness of the intervention (Cho et al. 2002).

Electroencephalographic-neurofeedback (EEG-NF) have been developed as non-pharmacological approaches regarding ADHD treatment. Neurofeedback (NF) is a form of behavioral training aimed at developing skills for self- regulation of brain activity to achieve desired audio-visual rewards (Heinrich et al 2007).

NF training in ADHD seeks to normalize aberrant EEG activity. The NF protocol introduced by Lubar and Shouse (1976), which was based on training conditioned increases of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR; 12–14 Hz), led to a reduction of hyperactivity. The training process extends in controlling further frequency parameters of Delta (0.5~3Hz), Theta (4~7Hz), Alpha (8~12Hz), and Beta (15~18Hz) (Cho et al. 2002). The EEG-NF treatment for ADHD has reported promising results not only in significant reductions in hyperactive, inattentive, and disruptive behaviors, but also improvements in academic performance and IQ scores (Monastra et al. 1999). 

The role of sound in the EEG application is limited to the use of auditory display describing NF, accompanied by alarming or rewarding sound events reflecting brain activity achievements.

An exception is Laffere and colleagues (2020) study, whose aim was to examine ADHD children’s direct attention to different sound streams according to temporal intervals.

Within the last few years, EEG-NF has been incorporated with immersive technologies. Both VR and AR provide controlled environments by removing distractions and providing stimuli that get the subjects’ attention and increasing their ability to concentrate. Based on the immersive, interactive and imaginal advantages, the XR technologies extend patient’s attention for a longer period of time than other methods can (Cho et al. 2002). Researchers have proposed interventions through gamified structured activities (Sonne & Jensen 2016; Granic et al. 2014). In this sense, there has been a significant development in therapies based on educational games coined as Serious Games (Griffiths et al. 2017; Avila-Pesantez et al. 2018).

In the above technological developments the emphasis is always directed in the visual aspects of the immersion creating thus a great need for audio and sound improvement.
 
Observing the recent studies conducted within the last year or so, which relate the emotional analysis with neurofeedback, investigate the audio perception in ADHD children and the XR developments, reveal a tendency of the upcoming focal point the ADHD EEG neurofeedback treatment and a feeling of "right momentum" for the this research implementation I'm about to propose.
